# curl-resume
```bash 
curl https://resume.joehackett.info 
```

This project leverages the serverless framework to create endpoints on https://resume.joehackett.info that offer information about my skills, interests, and experience. 

With minimal changes to the serverless.yml file, anyone should be able to adapt this project to create a curl resume of their own.
